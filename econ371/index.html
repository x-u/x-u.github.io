<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The objective of this course is to discuss the role of government in markets where competitive equilibria fail. During the course, we will go through the economic foundations of regulatory analysis, and how they are applied to real life scenarios that depart from the ideal of competitive markets. You will be able to recognize such market failures and to learn about the solutions devised over time to address them. You will be encouraged to evaluate the outcomes of such economic policies using concrete examples. Looking at different case studies, we will raise questions such as the following: Is economic regulation a necessity? Does regulation make up for market failure? What are the unintended consequences? Does it impose an even heavier burden to firms/consumers/society?</p>

<p>The course will be broken into three parts. In the first part, we will review the economic models of firm competition and the necessity of regulation from a theoretical point of view. In the second part, we will study various situations where antitrust analysis is applied. We will study market structure, horizontal/vertical mergers, price discrimination, and platform competition. In the third part, we will introduce economic regulation by studying the behavior of natural monopolies and regulatory options for dealing with them.</p>

<p>“One of the most exciting areas of economic policy is government regulation and antitrust. These efforts affect virtually all aspects of our lives ranging from the food we eat to the prices we pay.” (VHS). For example, what happens to the price of airline tickets if Air Canada acquires WestJet? Should Wal-Mart be banned because it drives local grocery stores out of business? Should car manufacturers be allowed to sell directly to consumers? Why is Halo not available on PlayStation? Is Apple abusing its market power by prohibiting apps to redirect users to their own website for purchases? There are countless cases of regulation, and we will only have time to cover a limited number, but we will cover the most basic rationales that can be applied in many of these issues.</p>

<h5 id="readings">Readings</h5>
<p>Textbook: Economics of Regulation and Antitrust, Fifth Edition, By <em>W. Kip Viscusi, Joseph E. Harrington, Jr. and David E. M. Sappington</em> (VHS)</p>

<ul>
  <li>The textbook can be purchased at the <a href="https://www.campusbookstore.com/?ID=90&amp;Course=ECON23488">Campus Bookstore</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0262038064">Amazon</a> or used copies from places such as eBay, AbeBooks, or Facebook Marketplace.</li>
  <li>There aren’t a large amount of differences between the fourth and fifth edition. So, the fourth edition is fine too but please make sure to check the table of contents to compare the two versions.</li>
  <li>A copy of the textbook was requested to put on <a href="https://library.queensu.ca/search/course-reserves/students">Course Reserves</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Newspaper/magazine: In addition to the textbook, you should keep informed about the regulatory issues by reading The Wall Street Journal or the Business section of The New York Times on a regular basis. A magazine such as Business Week or The Economist is also useful for this purpose.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note: These high quality news are NOT available to the vast majority of the population due to the paywalls. For example, the regular subscription for WSJ is $13/month. However, during your studies, you can get these newspapers free of charge through the <a href="https://guides.library.queensu.ca/c.php?g=501533&amp;p=3435579#selectednewspapers">library</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other readings: Other materials will be posted on the course website under each class. Please read the materials before class.</p>

<h2 id="requirement">Requirement</h2>
<h5 id="overview">Overview</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Short essay &amp; presentation (20%): 3 essays and 3 presentations.</li>
  <li>Term paper (20%) &amp; presentation (15%)</li>
  <li>Empirical project (35%)</li>
  <li>Class participation (10%)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="short-essays--presentation">Short essays &amp; presentation</h5>
<p>Each student will write three short essays. For each essay, each student will be assigned a broad topic (e.g., merger, collusion), then the student will choose any real-world cases related to that topic. The cases covered in each of the essays cannot be the same. The student will make a short presentation during the class, followed by a brief Q&amp;A from the audience. The goal of the essay and presentation is to relate the economic theory/reasoning to real-world cases and clearly convey the ideas in front of their peers.</p>

<p>The essay and presentation should contain background, arguments from both sides, how they are related to class material, and the author’s own analysis. The essay is evaluated based on the clarity and conciseness of the writing, relevance to class material, and the logic of the analysis. The presentation is evaluated on the same elements plus the understanding of the case through Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Each short essay should be no longer than 1 page. The presentation should be no longer than 3 minutes (to be finalized depending on class enrollment) and contains no more than 5 slides.</p>

<p>The essay will be evaluated by the lecturer or/and the TA, and the presentation will be evaluated by all the students (instructions to follow).</p>

<p>Due date: Both the essay and slides (used for in-class presentation) are due the night before class. For example, for a presentation scheduled on Oct 8, both the essay and slides have to be submitted by 11:59PM of Oct 7.</p>

<h5 id="term-paper--presentation">Term paper &amp; presentation</h5>
<p>The format of the term paper is similar to the short essay, but requires more in-depth treatment.  To get a good mark, you are expected to demonstrate knowledge of a wider reading beyond the course material, and be able to connect the economic theory of regulation with the practice of regulation. It should include a significant amount of one’s original analysis. It also should include references and a bibliography.</p>

<p>Students are free to analyze any one or multiple cases (it can also be one covered in the short essays) OR one sector/industry for the term paper.</p>

<p>Presentation???
Due date: The term paper is due on XXX?</p>

<h1 id="others">Others</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Student personal website: I strongly recommend students to have their own personal website to showcase their school projects. When applying for jobs, it can be helpful for employers to learn more about you if you have a personal website. The school projects showcased on the website can help employers learn your knowledge and experience on certain topics. This has been an increasing popular channel to signal one’s ability, especially in the tech industry.</li>
  <li>COVID-related issues:
All have to wear masks during class. No food/drink is allowed.
Presentation: masks are required.</li>
  <li>Plagirithm: randomly select papers to run thru TurnItIn, if too similar, then send the case to university office.</li>
</ul>
