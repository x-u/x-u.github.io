<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The objective of this course is to discuss the role of government in markets where competitive equilibria fail. During the course, we will go through the economic foundations of regulatory analysis, and how they are applied to real life scenarios that depart from the ideal of competitive markets. You will be able to recognize such market failures and to learn about the solutions devised over time to address them. You will be encouraged to evaluate the outcomes of such economic policies using concrete examples. Looking at different case studies, we will raise questions such as the following: Is economic regulation a necessity? Does regulation make up for market failure? What are the unintended consequences? Does it impose an even heavier burden to firms/consumers/society?</p>

<p>The course will be broken into three parts. In the first part, we will review the economic models of firm competition and the necessity of regulation from a theoretical point of view. In the second part, we will study various situations where antitrust analysis is applied. We will study market structure, horizontal/vertical mergers, price discrimination, and platform competition. In the third part, we will introduce economic regulation by studying the behavior of natural monopolies and regulatory options for dealing with them.</p>

<p>“One of the most exciting areas of economic policy is government regulation and antitrust. These efforts affect virtually all aspects of our lives ranging from the food we eat to the prices we pay.” (VHS). For example, what happens to the price of airline tickets if Air Canada acquires WestJet? Should Wal-Mart be banned because it drives local grocery stores out of business? Should car manufacturers be allowed to sell directly to consumers? Why is Halo not available on PlayStation? Is Apple abusing its market power by prohibiting apps to redirect users to their own website for purchases? There are countless cases of regulation, and we will only have time to cover a limited number, but we will cover the most basic rationales that can be applied in many of these issues.</p>

<h4 id="readings">Readings</h4>
<p>Textbook: Economics of Regulation and Antitrust, Fifth Edition, By <em>W. Kip Viscusi, Joseph E. Harrington, Jr. and David E. M. Sappington</em> (VHS)</p>

<ul>
  <li>The textbook can be purchased at the <a href="https://www.campusbookstore.com/?ID=90&amp;Course=ECON23488">Campus Bookstore</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0262038064">Amazon</a> or used copies from places such as eBay, AbeBooks, or Facebook Marketplace.</li>
  <li>There aren’t a large amount of differences between the fourth and fifth edition. So, the fourth edition is fine too but please compare the table of contents as well as the Preface section where the authors discuss the differences compared to the fourth version.</li>
  <li>An electronic copy of the textbook was requested to put on <a href="https://library.queensu.ca/search/course-reserves/students">Course Reserves</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Newspaper/magazine: In addition to the textbook, you should keep informed about the regulatory issues by reading The Wall Street Journal or the Business section of The New York Times on a regular basis. A magazine such as Business Week or The Economist is also useful for this purpose.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note: These high quality news are NOT available to the vast majority of the population due to the paywalls. For example, the regular subscription for WSJ is $13/month. However, during your studies, you can get these newspapers free of charge through the <a href="https://guides.library.queensu.ca/c.php?g=501533&amp;p=3435579#selectednewspapers">library</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other readings: Other materials will be posted on the course website under each class. Please read the materials before class.</p>

<h4 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h4>
<ul>
  <li>ECON 212 or equivalent</li>
  <li>ECON 250 or equivalent</li>
  <li>Knowledge of a statistical software: Python, Stata, R, or other statistical software/packages</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirement">Requirement</h2>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Short essay &amp; presentation (20%): 3 essays and 3 presentations.</li>
  <li>Term paper (20%) &amp; presentation (15%)</li>
  <li>Empirical project (35%)</li>
  <li>Class participation (10%)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="short-essays--presentation">Short essays &amp; presentation</h4>
<p>Each student will work on three short essays and present their work in front of the class. Students can either work alone or in pairs. For each essay, each student will be assigned a broad topic (e.g., merger, collusion), then the student will choose any real-world cases related to that topic. The cases covered in each of the essays cannot be the same. The student(s) will make a short presentation during the class, followed by a brief Q&amp;A from the audience. The goal of the essay and presentation is to relate the economic theory/reasoning to real-world cases and clearly convey the ideas in front of their peers.</p>

<p>The essay and presentation should contain background, arguments from both sides, how they are related to class material, and the student’s own analysis. The essay is evaluated based on the clarity and conciseness of the writing, relevance to class material, and the logic of the analysis. The presentation is evaluated on the same elements plus the understanding of the case through Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Each short essay should be no longer than 1 page. The presentation should be no longer than 3 minutes (to be finalized depending on class enrollment) and contains no more than 5 slides.</p>

<p>The essay will be evaluated by the lecturer or/and the TA, and the presentation will be evaluated by all the students (instructions to follow).</p>

<p>Due date: Both the essay and slides (used for in-class presentation) are due the night before each scheduled presentation. For example, for a presentation scheduled on Oct 8, both the essay and slides have to be submitted by 11:59PM of Oct 7.</p>

<p>Submission: The essay will be submitted through onQ, and the slides submitted through OneDrive.</p>

<p>Late submission of essay: Late submission will be penalized by 10% every day. For example, if the due date is Oct 7 and the essay was submitted on Oct 9, and if the score without penalty is 80, then the final adjusted score will be 80 x (1 - 10% x 2) = 64.</p>

<p>Late submission of slides: The slides used for in-class presentation have to be submitted before the deadline by uploading it to the appropriate folder. If not, the presenter will have to make the presentation without slides. Due to COVID protocols and time constraints, all slides will be compiled in the order of presentation before class.</p>

<h4 id="term-paper--presentation">Term paper &amp; presentation</h4>
<p>The format of the term paper is similar to the short essay, but requires more in-depth treatment. Students can also choose to work alone or in pairs. Students are free to analyze any one or multiple cases/industries for the term paper. To get a good mark, you are expected to demonstrate knowledge of a wider reading beyond the course material, and be able to connect the economic theory of regulation with the practice of regulation. It should include a significant amount of one’s original analysis. It also should include references and a bibliography.</p>

<p>Length:???<br />
Presentation???
Due date: Similar to the essay, the term paper is also due the day before the assigned presentation date. For example, for a presentation scheduled on Dec 3, the term paper is due by 11:59PM of Dec 2. Note that there is no due date of the slides. At the time of presentation, the slides stored in the shared folder will be used. In other words, the presenter can keep editing the slides until the last minute as long as the slides are updated to the appropriate folder.</p>

<p>Late submission of term paper: Same policy as late submission of essay.</p>

<h4 id="empirical-project">Empirical project</h4>
<p>We will examine a particular industry through data analysis.</p>

<p>The project is similar to a very long homework. Students are expected to work on this throughout the semester.</p>

<p>Students are encouraged to discuss with others, but have to write their own answers for all questions.</p>

<h2 id="submission-system">Submission System</h2>
<p>We will use both OneDrive and onQ for this course.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Essays, term paper, project will be submitted through onQ.</li>
  <li>All slides and peer evaluation will be submitted through OneDrive.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="submission-through-onq">Submission Through onQ</h4>
<p>Students have different due dates for their essays and term paper. There will be one “Assignment” for every week. For students who have scheduled presentation in that week, they should submit their essays or term papers through the particular “Assignment”.</p>

<h4 id="submission-through-onedrive">Submission Through OneDrive</h4>
<p>Each student will receive invitations to join two shared folders: <em>ECON371</em> and <em>FirstLastName</em>.</p>

<p><em>ECON371</em> is a view-only folder shared to all students. It contains presentation schedules of short essays and term papers. The project questions will also be updated to this folder.</p>

<p><em>FirstLastName</em> folder is an editable folder shared between the lecturer, the TA, and the student only. The submissions of slides will be made in this folder. For example, a student Adam Smith has his first essay presentation scheduled on October 8. The essay and slides are due by 11:59PM of October 7. The essay needs to be submitted on onQ, and the slides need to be uploaded to the <em>AdamSmith/Essay/</em> folder.</p>

<p>Please note the shared folder is used strictly for submission purposes. For other course-related files or files that are not final submissions, please keep them in a separate local folder.</p>

<h4 id="peer-evaluation-of-presentation">Peer Evaluation of Presentation</h4>
<p>The evaluations of presentations are made through the shared OneDrive folder <em>FirstLastName/Evaluation</em> folder. After the presentation, students need to leave their evaluation using the file <em>FirstLastName/Evaluation/week3.xlsx</em> (for presentations in the 3rd week). Later, the lecturer/TA collects all the evaluations in each student’s folder and calculates the score for each presenter. Each presenter will get notified of their grades in <em>FirstLastName/Essay/score1.txt</em> file.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Student personal website: I strongly recommend students to have their own personal website to showcase their school projects. When applying for jobs, it can be helpful for employers to learn more about you if you have a personal website. The school projects showcased on the website can help employers learn your knowledge and experience on certain topics. This has been an increasing popular channel to signal one’s ability, especially in the tech industry.</li>
  <li>COVID-related issues:
All have to wear masks during class. No food/drink is allowed.
Presentation: masks are required.
<!-- - Plagirithm: randomly select papers to run thru TurnItIn, if too similar, then send the case to university office. --></li>
