<A HREF="http://x-u.github.io/paper/algorithmic_pricing_and_competition.pdf"><B>Algorithmic Pricing and Competition: Empirical Evidence from the German Retail Gasoline Market</B></A>
with Stephanie Assad (Queen's), Robert Clark (Queen's) and Daniel Ershov (TSE)<br>
We provide the first empirical analysis of the relationship between algorithmic pricing (AP) and competition by studying the impact of adoption in Germany’s retail gasoline market, where AP software became widely available in 2017. Because adoption dates are unknown, we identify adopting stations by testing for structural breaks in AP markers, finding most breaks to be around the time of widespread AP introduction. Because station adoption is endogenous, we instrument using headquarter adoption. Adoption increases margins, but only for nonmonopolists. In duopoly markets, margins increase only if both stations adopt, suggesting that AP adoption has a significant effect on competition.

<A HREF="http://x-u.github.io/Xu_JMP.pdf"><B>Technology Adoption in Input-Output Networks</B></A>
with Xintong Han (Concordia University)<br><i><B>R&R Management Science</B></i> <br>
This paper investigates the role of network structure in technology adoption. In particular, we study how the network of individual agents can slow down the speed of adoption. We study this issue in the context of the Python programming language by modeling the decisions to adopt Python version 3 by software packages. Python 3 provides advanced features but is not backward compatible with Python 2, which implies adoption costs. Moreover, packages form an input-output network through dependency on other packages in order to avoid writing duplicate code, and they face additional adoption costs from dependencies without Python 3 support. We build a dynamic model of technology adoption that incorporates the input-output network. With a complete dataset of package characteristics for historical releases and user downloads, we draw the input-output network and develop a new estimation method based on the dependency relationship. Estimation results show the average cost of one incompatible dependency is one-third the fixed cost of updating a package's code. Simulations show the input-output network contributes to 1.5 years of adoption inertia. We conduct counterfactual policies of promotion in subcommunities and find significant heterogeneous effects on the adoption rates due to differences in network structure.

with Luis Cabral (NYU Stern)<br><i><B>Economic Inquiry</B></i> 59 (2021)<br>
We test the theory that seller reputation moderates the effect of demand shocks on a seller's propensity to price gouge. From mid January to mid March 2020, 3M masks were priced 2.72 times higher than Amazon sold them in 2019. However, the difference (in price ratios) between a post-COVID-19 entrant and an established seller is estimated to be about 1.6 at times of maximum scarcity, that is, post-COVID-19 entrants price at approximately twice the level of established sellers. Similar results are obtained for Purell hand sanitizer. We also consider cumulative reviews as a measure of what a seller has to lose from damaging its reputation and, again, obtain similar results. Finally, we explore policy implications of our results.

Many online platforms rely on users to voluntarily provide content. What motivates users to contribute content for free, however, is not well understood. In this paper, we use a revealed-preference approach to show that career concerns play an important role in user contributions to Stack Overflow, the largest online Q&A community. We investigate how activities that can enhance a user's reputation vary before and after the user finds a new job. We contrast this reputation-generating activity with activities that do not improve a user's reputation. After finding a new job, users contribute 23.7% less in reputation-generating activity; by contrast, they reduce their non-reputation-generating activity by only 7.4%. These findings suggest that users contribute to Stack Overflow in part because they perceive such contributions as a way to improve future employment prospects. We provide direct evidence against alternative explanations such as integer constraints, skills mismatch, and dynamic selection effects.

<A HREF="https://x-u.github.io/Xu_Platform_Competition.pdf"><B>Platform Competition with Local Network Effects </B></A><br>
This paper presents a dynamic model of price competition between two networks in which consumers value local network effects. Specifically, each consumer’s utility level depends on the number of her neighbors in the same network. Consumers in different neighborhoods choose their networks, and each network competes for new customers in different neighborhoods with a homogeneous entry price. I characterize equilibrium market structure with a combination of analytical and numerical solutions, and compare them to results from network effect models that are global, in which a consumer benefits from all other consumers in the same network. I provide sufficient conditions such that one firm dominants both local markets, as well as sufficient conditions that each firm is the dominant one in each local market.
